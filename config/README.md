You can add it to your PowerShell profile by running the following command, in an elevated (Administrator) PowerShell:

```powershell
irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/v-amorim/self_development/main/config/powershell/SetupPowershell.ps1" | iex
```

If for some reason the command above doesn't work, download the `SetupPowershell.ps1` and enter its path on the following command in the PowerShell:

```powershell
Invoke-Expression -Command (Get-Content -Path "./SetupPowershell.ps1" -Raw)
```
